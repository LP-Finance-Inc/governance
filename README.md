# LP Finance Governance

## Governance Flow
Prior to creating a governance vote on Realms, submit an issue with a relevant tag. Example proposal can be found [here](./template.md).

Once there are enough discussions on the proposal, head to [Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/xLPFi) to create a governance vote.
